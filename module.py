# 模組
# Notes:
# Python has a lot of built-in modules.
# Third-party modules can be installed using pip. i.e. pip install numpy


# Example: 
#import tool
# OR
#import tool as numMAX

#print(tool.author)
#max_num = print(tool.max_num(5, 10, 15))

# import specific function from a module
from tool import max_num as max
num = print(max(5,10,20))
